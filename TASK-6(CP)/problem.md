Soham loves to play with Pythagorean triplets.So this time he challenged his friends to a game involving pythagorean triplets.  
They will be given a random natural number **n** and the task is to find three natural numbers **a** **b** **c** forming pythogorean triplets such that 
**a+b+c = n**. The person who will find all such pythagorean triplets first will be declared as the pythagorean champion.  
Help Soham in becoming pthagorean champion.

## **INPUT**  
  
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases **t** (1≤t≤1000000). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤1000).  
  
## **OUTPUT**

For each test case print the number possible of triplets a,b,c in a new line
